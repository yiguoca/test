This manages a collection of test operations that can be utilized to verify the setup/configuration of the vsphere-csi-driver and its respective storage resources. We extend the [base definition](/bases/vsphere-csi/vsphere-csi-test/) and on the [london-non-prod group definition](/groups/vsphere-csi/london-non-prod/vsphere-csi-test/)to execute all the common tests against the london test infrastructure cluster.
